# FDBMS

The implementation of the code includes reading the input file and caching it into a dictionary. Further, in the first case each time the user asks for the sum of a column the program already has the cases, whereas the program receives the data from a metadata file in the latter case. Thus, the program takes a significant greater time in the second case as compared to the first one.

Time taken in the first case: 0.03290370099421125 seconds.
Time taken in the second case: 0.0683168219984509 seconds.

The following time was generated using a sample test case. The case has been attached in the submission file.
